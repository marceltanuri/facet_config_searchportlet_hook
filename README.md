# facet_config_searchportlet_hook
This hook was developed for changing the default facet configuration value that is used by the Velocity variable $theme.search().   Since the search portlet is embbeded in the theme through the Velocity variable $theme.search(), there is no way to change the facets search configs, except by hooking.
